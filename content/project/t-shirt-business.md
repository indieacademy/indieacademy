## Introduction
Welcome to the T-Shirt Business project, where you'll learn building an online business from scratch. We've interviewed the best in the field to bring you scam-free best-in-class projects instructions. Everything we'll do is a massive experiment, wether you'll end up selling just a few T-Shirts or start your fashion business afterwards.

Making money for a living is nice and yet there has to be more. One of the core goals of Indie Academy is to constantly keep learning new things to a level of mastery. While learning itself is honorable its also the new procrastination, everyone wants to learn everyone and there is so much more to learn. Thats why we'll build to learn and don't learn to build.

Topics youâ€™ll learn in this course include:

- Nieche analysis
